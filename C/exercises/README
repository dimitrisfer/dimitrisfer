# C Programming ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

This folder contains my first steps in learning the C programming language.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s inside?

- Basic programs to understand how C works
- Simple exercises to get familiar with syntax, variables, input/output, and logic
- Comments and clean code to help me (and others) follow what each file does

## ðŸ›  Files

- `hello_world.c`: The classic first program â€“ prints "Hello, world!"
- `swap_numbers.c`: Swaps two integers using a temporary variable
- `conditions.c`: A small program using `if` statements to check even/odd numbers
- `loops.c`: A program that prints numbers using a `for` or `while` loop

*(More coming soon as I keep learning!)*

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Understand how memory, variables, and control structures work in C  
- Learn how to compile C programs using `gcc`  
- Practice writing clean and efficient code  
- Get more comfortable with lower-level programming concepts

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

You can compile and run each program using:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o filename
./filename
